          <h2 className="text-xl font-bold mb-3">1. Introduction</h2>
          <p className="mb-4 text-sm leading-relaxed">
            SM Data Sub ("we," "our," or "us"), operated by Sir Smarewa Ltd (RC: 9198148), a company registered in Nigeria, 
            provides a mobile application ("App") that enables users to purchase airtime, data bundles, pay utility bills, 
            subscribe to cable TV services, purchase examination pins, and manage digital wallets. This Privacy Policy explains 
            how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your information when you use our mobile application. Please read this 
            privacy policy carefully. If you do not agree with the terms of this privacy policy, please do not access the application.

          <h3 className="text-base font-semibold mb-2">2.1 Personal Information Provided During Registration</h3>
          <p className="mb-2 text-sm leading-relaxed">When you create an account, we collect:</p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-5 mb-4 text-sm space-y-1">
            <li><strong>Full Name</strong> — used for account identification and virtual account creation</li>
            <li><strong>Email Address</strong> — used for account login, password recovery, and transactional notifications</li>
            <li><strong>Phone Number</strong> — used for account login, service delivery (airtime/data purchases), and communication</li>
            <li><strong>Password</strong> — stored in encrypted/hashed form for account security</li>
            <li><strong>Referral Code</strong> (optional) — used to track referral relationships and credit referral bonuses</li>
          </ul>

          <h3 className="text-base font-semibold mb-2">2.2 Financial and Transaction Information</h3>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-5 mb-4 text-sm space-y-1">
            <li><strong>Wallet Balance</strong> — maintained to facilitate purchases and transfers within the App</li>
            <li><strong>Transaction History</strong> — records of all purchases including airtime, data, electricity, TV subscriptions, exam pins, cashback earned/withdrawn, referral bonuses, and wallet deposits</li>
            <li><strong>Virtual Bank Account Details</strong> — generated via our payment partner (PaymentPoint/PalmPay) for wallet funding, including account number and account name</li>
            <li><strong>Meter Numbers</strong> — entered by users for electricity bill payments</li>
            <li><strong>Smart Card / IUC Numbers</strong> — entered by users for cable TV subscription payments</li>
            <li><strong>Cashback Wallet Information</strong> — balance, earnings, and withdrawal history</li>
          </ul>

          <h3 className="text-base font-semibold mb-2">2.3 Device and Technical Information</h3>
          <p className="mb-2 text-sm leading-relaxed">We automatically collect certain device and technical information, including:</p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-5 mb-4 text-sm space-y-1">
            <li><strong>Device Model, Manufacturer, and OS Version</strong> — used for compatibility, debugging, and login session tracking</li>
            <li><strong>Platform Information</strong> (Android/iOS/Web) — to deliver platform-specific features and track login sessions</li>
            <li><strong>Device Identifier</strong> — a unique device identifier used for login session tracking and security monitoring</li>
            <li><strong>User Agent String</strong> — browser/app identification string for session tracking</li>
            <li><strong>Screen Resolution</strong> — for optimizing the user interface</li>
            <li><strong>Network Connection Status and Type</strong> — to handle offline scenarios and optimize performance</li>
            <li><strong>Whether the Device is Virtual/Emulated</strong> — for security and fraud detection purposes</li>
          </ul>

          <h3 className="text-base font-semibold mb-2">2.4 Biometric Data</h3>
          <p className="mb-4 text-sm leading-relaxed">
            If you enable biometric authentication (fingerprint, face recognition, or iris scanning), the App uses your 
            device's native biometric APIs to verify your identity. <strong>We do not store, transmit, or have access to 
            your actual biometric data</strong>. Biometric verification is processed entirely on your device using the 
            operating system's secure biometric framework. We only store a local preference indicating whether biometric 
            login is enabled and the associated account identifier.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-base font-semibold mb-2">2.5 Push Notification Tokens</h3>
          <p className="mb-4 text-sm leading-relaxed">
            When you grant notification permission, we collect your Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) push notification token. 
            This token is stored in our database and associated with your user account to deliver transaction alerts, 
            credit notifications, promotional messages, and important service updates. We also store basic device metadata 
            (platform type, whether the device is native) alongside the token for notification delivery optimization.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-base font-semibold mb-2">2.6 Login Session Data</h3>
          <p className="mb-4 text-sm leading-relaxed">
            Each time you log in, we record a login session that includes: timestamp, platform (Android/iOS/Web), 
            device information, user agent, and a flag indicating whether the login appears suspicious. This data is 
            used for security monitoring and unauthorized access detection.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-base font-semibold mb-2">2.7 Transaction PIN</h3>
          <p className="mb-4 text-sm leading-relaxed">
            You may set up a 4-digit transaction PIN for authorizing purchases. This PIN is stored locally on your 
            device and is used to verify your identity before processing financial transactions. The PIN is not 
            transmitted to our servers.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-base font-semibold mb-2">2.8 Profile Information</h3>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-5 mb-4 text-sm space-y-1">
            <li><strong>Avatar/Profile Picture</strong> — optionally uploaded by users for profile personalization</li>
            <li><strong>Account Number</strong> — a system-generated number for in-app identification</li>
            <li><strong>Referral Code</strong> — a system-generated unique code for the referral program</li>
          </ul>

          <h2 className="text-xl font-bold mb-3">3. How We Use Your Information</h2>
